1  You are lost in the woods when all of a sudden a door appears in front of you.
2  It looks like the door is locked but there are some items on the ground that might open it.
3  On the ground you find a wrench and a lockpick. You can only take one, which item do you want to take?
4  You pick up the wrench and try to open the door but fail. Would you like to swap it for the lockpick?
5  You pick up the lockpick and try to open the door.
6  You opened the door! You walk through and feel a strange force surround your body.

7  You are instantly teleported to the bottom of mountain Edhellond.
8  the greatest and tallest mountain in all of Avallone. You squint your tiny eyes to try and make
9  out a strange object you see at the top. It's a castle!
10  Would you like to continue or run away?


13  After days of climbing you finally make it to the top.
14  It's freezing cold and nightfall approaches as you walk up to the castle door.
15  You try to open the door, but it is frozen. You are going to need something to melt the ice.
16  You search the area and find a tinderbox and some dry logs. Would you like to pick it up?
17  Using the tinderbox and dry logs you light a fire and melt the ice on the door.

18  The area becomes surrounded by smoke that can be seen miles away.
19  You hear a loud screech! AHHHHHHHHHH! It's a vampire!


16  You knock on the frozen door and it starts to slowly open by itself until you hear a loud bang and the
17  door stops moving. It's pitch dark inside and you begin to enter the castle...
